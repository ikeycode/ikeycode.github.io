I'm Ikey Doherty, founder and lead of the [Serpent OS](https://serpentos.com) project.

I've worked exclusively on open source projects for the last two decades, both within the established industry and as a startup/competitor. My primary expertise incorporates the build and lifecycle management of open source operating systems, chiefly LinuxÂ®.
 
I have an extensive background in backend systems engineering roles, be they full delivery pipelines, software compliance, distributed build systems, etc.
For the last 6 months I've been working on a distributed build system to leverage token-authenticated agent systems in a scalable pipeline solution
to quickly and securely deploy software builds and updates for the Serpent OS project.
